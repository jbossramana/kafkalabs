1. Install Debezium Connector Plugin

confluent-hub install debezium/debezium-connector-mysql:2.6.1

2. Create a Debezium CDC Connector

POST http://localhost:8083/connectors
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "mysql-cdc-connector",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.mysql.MySqlConnector",
    "tasks.max": "1",
    "database.hostname": "localhost",
    "database.port": "3306",
    "database.user": "debezium",
    "database.password": "dbz",
    "database.server.id": "184054",
    "database.server.name": "mysqlserver1",
    "database.include.list": "test_db",
    "table.include.list": "test_db.test_table",
    "database.history.kafka.bootstrap.servers": "localhost:9092",
    "database.history.kafka.topic": "schema-changes.test_db",
    "include.schema.changes": "true",
    "snapshot.mode": "initial"
  }
}

Submit using:

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --data @connector-config.json \
     http://localhost:8083/connectors



3. How Debezium Sends DELETE Events to Kafka

When a delete happens in the source database, Debezium sends a message to the Kafka topic representing that table. Here's what the message looks like:

{
  "before": {
    "id": 101,
    "name": "Alice"
  },
  "after": null,
  "op": "d",
  "ts_ms": 1720965212123
}

Debezium uses "op": "d" to mark a delete

The deleted row’s previous state is in the before field

after is null — because the row no longer exists


Debezium op Field – Supported Operations
op 	 Type	      Meaning
c	  Create	A new row was inserted
u	  Update	A row was updated
d	  Delete	A row was deleted
r	  Read  	A row was read during the initial snapshot


Reset Offsets:
==============

Kafka Connect stores offsets in an internal Kafka topic (usually connect-offsets). To replay a source connector, you can reset these offsets, 
so the connector thinks it's starting fresh.

curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8083/connectors/<your-connector-name>/offsets
