Difference between a generic record and a specific record lies in how they represent and handle Avro data.

Generic Record: A generic record is a dynamic representation of Avro data that does not require a specific Avro schema. It allows accessing and manipulating 
fields dynamically using a generic interface. The generic record can be used to handle Avro data with varying or unknown schemas, making it more flexible 
in handling dynamic data structures. However, since it operates on generic data, it does not provide compile-time type safety or schema validation.

Specific Record: A specific record is a generated class based on a specific Avro schema. It provides compile-time type safety and allows direct access to 
fields using generated methods. Specific records are strongly typed, meaning the fields and their types are known and enforced at compile time. This type 
safety provides advantages like autocompletion, type checking, and easier integration with IDEs. Specific records are suitable when you have a well-defined 
Avro schema and want to leverage compile-time checks and type safety.

Here are some key points to consider when choosing between generic and specific records:

Flexibility vs. Type Safety: Generic records offer flexibility for handling dynamic or evolving data structures, while specific records provide type safety and 
better integration with the programming language's type system.

Schema Validation: Specific records perform schema validation at compile time, ensuring that the data adheres to the schema. Generic records do not provide this 
level of validation, as the schema is not known at compile time.

Code Generation: Specific records require code generation based on Avro schemas using tools or libraries specific to the programming language. Generic records 
do not require code generation, allowing more dynamic handling of Avro data.

Performance: Specific records generally provide better performance than generic records due to their optimized code structure and direct field access methods.

In summary, the choice between generic and specific records depends on the specific use case and requirements. Use generic records when handling dynamic or 
unknown schemas, and use specific records when you have a well-defined schema and prefer compile-time type safety and schema validation.

  "type": "record",
  "name": "Transaction",
  "fields": [

}

GenericRecord
-------------

 ConsumerRecords<String, GenericRecord> records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));

            for (ConsumerRecord<String, GenericRecord> record : records) {
                GenericRecord transaction = record.value();

                // Accessing fields dynamically
                String transactionId = transaction.get("transactionId").toString();
                String accountId = transaction.get("accountId").toString();
                double amount = Double.parseDouble(transaction.get("amount").toString());
                
 
 Specific Record
 ----------------
 
 KafkaConsumer<String, Transaction> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(props);
        consumer.subscribe(Collections.singleton(TOPIC));

        while (true) {
            ConsumerRecords<String, Transaction> records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));

            for (ConsumerRecord<String, Transaction> record : records) {
                Transaction transaction = record.value();

                // Accessing fields using the specific generated class
                String transactionId = transaction.getTransactionId().toString();
                String accountId = transaction.getAccountId().toString();
                double amount = transaction.getAmount();
                
The choice between GenericRecord and specific Avro-generated classes depends on your use case and requirements. If you have a well-defined schema and prefer 
compile-time type safety, using specific Avro-generated classes is a recommended approach. If you need more flexibility and dynamic handling of Avro data with 
varying schemas, then GenericRecord provides a more generic and dynamic approach.
