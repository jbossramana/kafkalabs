In Kafka, a rack ID is a label used to indicate the physical or logical location of a broker within a cluster, particularly in 
multi-datacenter setups or environments where brokers are distributed across different racks or availability zones. 

The purpose of the rack ID is to help improve the fault tolerance and data locality of Kafka.

Key Points:
Data Replication: When Kafka replicates data across multiple brokers, it can use rack IDs to ensure that replicas are spread across different 
physical locations. This minimizes the risk of data loss in case of a rack or datacenter failure.

Configuration: You can set the rack ID for a broker in its configuration file (e.g., server.properties) using the broker.rack property.

Partition Assignment: When topics are created, Kafka can use the rack ID information to make smarter decisions about which brokers to assign
replicas to, based on the defined rack structure.

Improved Availability: By configuring rack IDs, you can enhance the availability of your Kafka cluster. If a broker in one rack goes down, 
Kafka can quickly reroute requests to a replica in a different rack.

Client Configuration: Clients can also be aware of rack IDs to optimize their data consumption patterns and improve latency by connecting 
to brokers in the same or nearby racks.

Using rack IDs is especially beneficial in distributed systems where network latency and fault tolerance are critical considerations.
