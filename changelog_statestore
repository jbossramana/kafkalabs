In Kafka Streams, a changelog topic is used to persist the state of the stream processing application. It stores the updates to the state store, allowing the application to 
recover its state in case of failures or restarts. On the other hand, a state store is an in-memory database that holds the current state of the stream processing application.
It's used for fast read and write operations during stream processing. So, in summary:

Changelog Topic: Persists the state of the application for fault tolerance and state recovery.

State Store: In-memory database holding the current state of the application for fast read and write operations.

The changelog topic and state store work together to ensure fault tolerance and consistency in stream processing applications.

In Kafka Streams, a KTable is essentially a materialized view of a Kafka topic represented as a table. It uses a changelog topic to maintain its state. The changelog topic
records all the changes to the state of the KTable as key-value pairs, enabling fault tolerance and state restoration in case of failures or restarts. This changelog topic
is crucial for ensuring the consistency and durability of the KTable's state across multiple instances of the stream processing application.
