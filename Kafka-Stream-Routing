EXAMPLE-1
=========

// Define the processing topology
  StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder();
  KStream<String, String> sourceStream = builder.stream("input-topic");

 // Branch the stream based on message content
 KStream<String, String>[] branches = sourceStream.split().branch(
 (key, value) -> value.contains("type1"), // condition for first output topic
 (key, value) -> value.contains("type2"), // condition for second output topic
 (key, value) -> true                     // default condition for remaining messages
   );

 // Route each branch to a different output topic
 branches[0].to("output-topic-1");
 branches[1].to("output-topic-2");
 branches[2].to("output-topic-3");      


Branching:

sourceStream.branch splits the stream into multiple branches based on the provided predicates.
The first branch captures messages containing "type1".
The second branch captures messages containing "type2".
The third branch captures all remaining messages.

Routing to Topics:

branches[0].to("output-topic-1") routes the first branch to output-topic-1.
branches[1].to("output-topic-2") routes the second branch to output-topic-2.
branches[2].to("output-topic-3") routes the third branch to output-topic-3.

EXAMPLE-2
=========

-- Create a stream for the input topic
CREATE STREAM input_stream (
    key VARCHAR KEY,
    value VARCHAR
) WITH (
    KAFKA_TOPIC = 'input-topic',
    VALUE_FORMAT = 'JSON'
);

-- Create a routed stream using CASE to determine the output topic
CREATE STREAM routed_stream AS
SELECT
    key,
    value,
    CASE
        WHEN value LIKE '%type1%' THEN 'output-topic-1'
        WHEN value LIKE '%type2%' THEN 'output-topic-2'
        ELSE 'output-topic-3'
    END AS output_topic
FROM input_stream;

-- Create output streams for each topic
CREATE STREAM output_topic_1 WITH (
    KAFKA_TOPIC = 'output-topic-1',
    VALUE_FORMAT = 'JSON'
) AS SELECT key, value FROM routed_stream WHERE output_topic = 'output-topic-1';

CREATE STREAM output_topic_2 WITH (
    KAFKA_TOPIC = 'output-topic-2',
    VALUE_FORMAT = 'JSON'
) AS SELECT key, value FROM routed_stream WHERE output_topic = 'output-topic-2';

CREATE STREAM output_topic_3 WITH (
    KAFKA_TOPIC = 'output-topic-3',
    VALUE_FORMAT = 'JSON'
) AS SELECT key, value FROM routed_stream WHERE output_topic = 'output-topic-3';


Camel Route
===========

@Bean
    public RouteBuilder routeBuilder() {
        return new RouteBuilder() {
            @Override
            public void configure() {
                from("kafka:input-topic?brokers=localhost:9092")
                    .choice()
                        .when(body().contains("type1"))
                            .to("kafka:output-topic-1?brokers=localhost:9092")
                        .when(body().contains("type2"))
                            .to("kafka:output-topic-2?brokers=localhost:9092")
                        .otherwise()
                            .to("kafka:output-topic-3?brokers=localhost:9092");
            }


Custom Kafka Consumer and Producer API 
======================================

KafkaConsumer<String, String> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(consumerProps);
        KafkaProducer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(producerProps);

        // Subscribe to the input topic
        consumer.subscribe(Collections.singletonList(INPUT_TOPIC));

        try {
            while (true) {
                ConsumerRecords<String, String> records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));
                for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> record : records) {
                    String value = record.value();

                    if (value.contains("type1")) {
                        producer.send(new ProducerRecord<>(OUTPUT_TOPIC_1, record.key(), value));
                    } else if (value.contains("type2")) {
                        producer.send(new ProducerRecord<>(OUTPUT_TOPIC_2, record.key(), value));
                    } else {
                        producer.send(new ProducerRecord<>(OUTPUT_TOPIC_3, record.key(), value));
                    }
                }
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            consumer.close();
            producer.close();
        }

The choice of approach depends on your specific use case, expertise, and requirements for flexibility, performance, and ease of development.


Limited Flexibility in ksqlDB
=============================

Complex Transformations:

Custom Logic: ksqlDB is designed to use SQL-like queries for stream processing. This works well for many standard operations (filtering, aggregations, joins), 
but implementing complex transformations or custom business logic that go beyond what SQL can express can be challenging or impossible.
Limited Functionality: You might need specific processing that requires intricate algorithms or custom processing functions, which ksqlDB cannot express or 
handle directly.

Extensibility:

UDFs (User-Defined Functions): While ksqlDB supports user-defined functions (UDFs) and user-defined aggregate functions (UDAFs), their creation requires additional 
Java development and deployment steps. This can add complexity and overhead compared to the ease of defining custom logic in a general-purpose programming language.
Plugins and Integrations: ksqlDB may not support all the plugins or integrations that a more flexible, code-based solution could support, limiting its adaptability 
in complex environments.

Operational Complexity:

Performance Tuning: While ksqlDB abstracts much of the complexity, this can also make fine-grained performance tuning more difficult. With custom code, you have 
complete control over threading, batching, and other performance-related configurations.
Scalability Issues: Although ksqlDB is designed to be scalable, very large or highly demanding applications might require more sophisticated scaling strategies 
or optimizations than ksqlDB can provide out-of-the-box.

Debugging and Monitoring:

Limited Debugging Tools: SQL queries are harder to debug compared to procedural code. Custom Kafka applications can have more sophisticated logging, debugging, 
and error-handling mechanisms.

Monitoring: While ksqlDB provides metrics and monitoring capabilities, integrating these with existing monitoring systems can be less straightforward compared to 
custom implementations.

Examples of Scenarios with Limited Flexibility

Advanced Stream Enrichment:

Suppose you need to enrich a stream with data from an external service (e.g., a REST API) based on complex business logic. Doing this in ksqlDB is not 
straightforward and often requires integrating with other services or custom code outside ksqlDB.

Complex Event Processing:

If you need to implement complex event processing (CEP) with intricate patterns, correlations, and custom windows, ksqlDB's SQL-based approach might not 
be sufficient, and a more flexible programming model like Apache Flink or a custom Kafka Streams application would be better suited.

Custom State Management:

When you need highly customized state management or custom handling of state stores, ksqlDB's abstractions might not offer the necessary control, whereas 
custom Kafka Streams or raw Consumer/Producer APIs would provide full control over state management.
