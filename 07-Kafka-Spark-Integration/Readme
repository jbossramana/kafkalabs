Functional Programming?

Spark is a language that was developed using Scala, and Scala indeed is a Functional Programming language.
Functional programming (often abbreviated FP) is the process of writing code by accumulating pure functions, 
avoiding shared states, mutable data, and side effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than 
imperative, and complete application flows through functions that do not store or modify the input.
