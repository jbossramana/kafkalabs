Let's consider a scenario where we have two Kafka topics: orders and customers. The orders topic contains information about customer orders, including the customer ID as the key and
the order details as the value. The customers topic contains information about customers, including the customer ID as the key and the customer details as the value.

We want to join the two streams based on the customer ID and enrich the order records with customer information. Here's how you can achieve that using KTable:

import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Serdes;
import org.apache.kafka.streams.KafkaStreams;
import org.apache.kafka.streams.StreamsBuilder;
import org.apache.kafka.streams.StreamsConfig;
import org.apache.kafka.streams.kstream.KStream;
import org.apache.kafka.streams.kstream.KTable;
import java.util.Properties;

public class OrderEnrichmentApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Properties config = new Properties();
        config.put(StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG, "order-enrichment-application");
        config.put(StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
        config.put(StreamsConfig.DEFAULT_KEY_SERDE_CLASS_CONFIG, Serdes.String().getClass());
        config.put(StreamsConfig.DEFAULT_VALUE_SERDE_CLASS_CONFIG, Serdes.String().getClass());

        StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder();

        // Create a KTable from the 'customers' topic
        KTable<String, String> customerTable = builder.table("customers");

        // Create a KStream from the 'orders' topic
        KStream<String, String> orderStream = builder.stream("orders");

        // Join the KStream with the KTable based on the customer ID
        KStream<String, String> enrichedOrders = orderStream
                .join(customerTable,
                        (orderKey, orderValue) -> orderKey, // Join key selector for the KStream
                        (orderValue, customerValue) -> "Order: " + orderValue + ", Customer: " + customerValue // Value joiner
                );

        // Print the enriched orders to the console
        enrichedOrders.foreach((key, value) -> System.out.println(value));

        KafkaStreams streams = new KafkaStreams(builder.build(), config);
        streams.start();

        // Shutdown the stream application gracefully on termination
        Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(streams::close));
    }
}



In this example, we create a KTable called customerTable from the customers topic, representing the customer data. Then, we create a KStream called orderStream from the
orders topic, representing the order data.

Next, we join the orderStream with the customerTable based on the customer ID. The join operation enriches each order record with the corresponding customer information. 
The enriched orders are then printed to the console.

Finally, we configure and start the Kafka Streams application.

This example showcases how KTable can be used to join and enrich data streams, in this case, combining order data with customer data based on a common key.


In the example provided, we are using a KTable for the customers topic and a KStream for the orders topic based on the characteristics and requirements of the data in each topic. 
Here's the rationale behind the choice:

Customers (KTable): The customers topic contains information about customers, and it is assumed that this information represents a mutable view of the customer data. A KTable is suitable for
representing a table-like structure that maintains the latest value for each key (customer ID). It provides the ability to perform interactive lookups and joins based on the key. In this case, 
we can use a KTable to represent the customer data and enable efficient lookup and join operations with the order data.

Orders (KStream): The orders topic contains information about individual orders placed by customers. Since each order is considered as an individual event, it makes sense to model it as a stream of
records using a KStream. A KStream represents an unbounded, continuous stream of events or records, where we can perform real-time processing and transformations on each individual event. In this case, 
we want to process and transform each order record independently and join it with the customer information.

By using a KTable for customers and a KStream for orders, we can leverage the respective strengths of each abstraction. The KTable provides a table-like view of the customer data, enabling efficient 
lookup and join operations. The KStream allows us to process and transform individual order records in real-time, facilitating event-by-event processing.

This combination of KTable and KStream allows us to perform join operations between the customer data (represented as a KTable) and the order data (represented as a KStream), enriching the order 
records with the corresponding customer information in a scalable and real-time manner.
