1. Problem:

Exception thrown when sending with key and payload{} to topic xyz TimeoutException: Expiring 1  records for xyz-topic-1:120000ms has 
passed since batch creation

Solution:

The buffer.memory) controls the total amount of memory available to the producer for buffering. If records are sent faster than they 
can be transmitted to the server then this buffer space will be exhausted. When the buffer space is exhausted additional send calls
will block. The threshold for time to block is determined by max.block.ms after which it throws a TimeoutException.

Increase the buffer.memory(default:32 MB)  of  max.block.ms (default: 60000ms)
