----------------------------

As the input topic has 2 partitions, we can launch upto 2 instances
of our application in parallel without doing any changes in the code.

[Kafka Streams application relies on KafkaConsumer]


practicals:
1. run script/word-count.bat
2. run 2 instances of the application
