In Kafka, the client ID is used to track the activities of individual clients in the Kafka cluster. Kafka brokers maintain a record of all 
connected clients and their associated client IDs. This information is stored in a metadata log maintained by the Kafka cluster.

To monitor client activity in Kafka, you can use the built-in command-line tool called kafka-consumer-groups or kafka-producer-perf-test. 
These tools allow you to view the status of your Kafka consumers and producers, including their client IDs, the topics they are subscribed 
to or publishing to, and the amount of data they have consumed or produced.

For example, to view the status of a consumer group, you can run the following command:

bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --group my-group --describe


This command will display information about all the consumers in the consumer group my-group, including their client IDs, the topics they are 
subscribed to, the partition assignments, and the lag between the latest message available on a partition and the last offset consumed by the consumer.

Similarly, to monitor the performance of a Kafka producer, you can use the kafka-producer-perf-test tool. This tool allows you to specify a 
producer client ID and track its message production rate and latency.

bin/kafka-producer-perf-test.sh --topic test-topic --num-records 100000 --record-size 1000 --throughput 100 --producer-props bootstrap.servers=localhost:9092
client.id=my-producer


In the above example, the kafka-producer-perf-test tool is used to simulate a producer that publishes 100,000 messages to the topic test-topic with 
a record size of 1000 bytes and a throughput of 100 messages per second. The producer's client ID is set to my-producer.

By monitoring client IDs in Kafka, you can gain insight into the performance of your Kafka applications and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
