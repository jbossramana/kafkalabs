public class ConsumerRecord<K,V>
extends java.lang.Object

A key/value pair to be received from Kafka. This also consists of a topic name and a partition number from which 
the record is being received, an offset that points to the record in a Kafka partition, and a timestamp as marked 
by the corresponding ProducerRecord.



public ConsumerRecords<K,V> pollâ€‹(java.time.Duration timeout)
============================================================

Fetch data for the topics or partitions specified using one of the subscribe/assign APIs. It is an error to not 
have subscribed to any topics or partitions before polling for data.

On each poll, consumer will try to use the last consumed offset as the starting offset and fetch sequentially. 
The last consumed offset can be manually set through seek(TopicPartition, long) or automatically set as the last 
committed offset for the subscribed list of partitions

This method returns immediately if there are records available. Otherwise, it will await the passed timeout. 
If the timeout expires, an empty record set will be returned
