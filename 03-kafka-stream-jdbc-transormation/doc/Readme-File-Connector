The example is used to demo how to use Kafka Connect to stream data from source which is  file test.txt 
to destination which is also a file, test.sink.txt. 



1. Start ZooKeeper
>zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties 
	

2. Start Kafka Server
>kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties


3. Start the Source and Sink connectors

>connect-standalone.sh config/connect-standalone.properties config/connect-file-source.properties config/connect-file-sink.properties

4. Start the Source connector

Write some content to the test.txt file
echo 'hello' >> test.txt
echo 'halo' >> test.txt
echo 'salut' >> test.txt

5.  Check whether the Source connector feed the test.txt content into the topic connect-test or not

>kafka-console-consumer.sh  --zookeeper localhost:2181 --from-beginning --topic connect-test


6. Check whether the Sink Connector write content to the test.sink.txt or not

cat test.sink.txt
