All the data that we are working on with KSQL is produced to Kafka topics by some client. This client can be any 
Application, Kafka connectors etc., which produces continuous never-ending data to the topics.

KSQL does not directly interact with these topics, it rather introduces a couple of abstractions in between to process
the data, which are known as Streams and Tables.

What are Streams and Tables?

Both Streams and Tables are wrappers on top of Kafka topics, which has continuous never-ending data. But, conceptually 
these abstractions are different because-

Streams represent data in motion capturing events happening in the world, and has the following features-

    Unbounded
    Storing a never-ending continuous flow of data and thus Streams are unbounded as they have no limit.
    
    Immutable
    Any new data that comes in gets appended to the current stream and does not modify any of the existing records, 
    making it completely immutable.

While A table represents the data at rest or a materialized view of that stream of events with the latest value of 
a key and has the following features-

    Bounded
    Represents a snapshot of the stream at a time, and therefore it has its limits defined.
    
    Mutable
    Any new data(<Key, Value> pair) that comes in gets added to the current table if the table does not have an 
    existing entry with the same key otherwise, the existing record is mutated to have the latest value for that key.
