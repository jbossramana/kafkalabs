Replication Throttling: The replica.fetch.max.bytes and replica.fetch.max.wait.ms properties control the rate at which followers fetch 
data from the leader. Throttling the replication rate can help prevent follower nodes from falling behind, and can reduce the impact of network 
and disk I/O bottlenecks.

Follower Lag Monitoring: Kafka provides a variety of metrics and tools for monitoring follower lag, such as the replica.lag.time.max.ms property, 
which determines the maximum time a follower is allowed to lag behind the leader before it is considered out of sync. 

Other important metrics include the replica.lag.max.messages and replica.lag.max.time.ms properties, which specify the maximum number of messages 
or time interval that a follower can lag behind the leader.

Follower Reassignment: In some cases, it may be necessary to reassign followers to different broker nodes in order to balance the workload and 
optimize replication performance. Kafka provides several tools for follower reassignment, including the kafka-reassign-partitions script and the 
PartitionReassignment API.
