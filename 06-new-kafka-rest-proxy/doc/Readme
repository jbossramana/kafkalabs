Confluent REST Proxy

The Confluent REST Proxy provides a RESTful interface to a Kafka cluster, making it easy to produce and consume messages, view the state of the cluster, and perform administrative actions without using the native Kafka protocol or clients.

Some example use cases are:

    Reporting data to Kafka from any frontend app built in any language not supported by official Confluent clients
    Ingesting messages into a stream processing framework that doesnâ€™t yet support Kafka
    Scripting administrative actions
