01 - Kafka Producer Exceptions
-------------------------------

TimeOutException 
----------------

The TimeoutException is a common error that can occur when working with Kafka producers. It indicates that the producer did not receive an 
acknowledgment (ack) from the Kafka broker within the specified timeout period.

When a producer sends a message to a Kafka broker, it expects to receive an acknowledgment to ensure that the message has been successfully received 
and replicated by the broker. The acknowledgment confirms that the message has been persisted and can be considered as "committed" in the Kafka cluster.

If the producer does not receive an acknowledgment within the configured timeout, a TimeoutException is thrown. This can happen due to several reasons:

Network latency: The broker may be experiencing network issues or high latency, causing delays in the acknowledgment.

High message throughput: If the Kafka cluster is under heavy load, it may take longer for the broker to process and acknowledge the producer's request.

Long-running operations: If the producer's request involves time-consuming operations such as message compression or encryption, it can contribute to 
longer processing times and potential timeouts.

Configuration settings: The timeout value configured in the producer's settings may be too low, causing the exception to be thrown before the acknowledgment 
is received.

When a TimeoutException occurs, the producer can retry sending the message or take appropriate error handling measures based on the application's requirements. 
Retrying the message send operation is a common approach to handle this error. However, it's important to implement an appropriate retry mechanism to avoid 
overwhelming the Kafka cluster with duplicate messages.

Solution
---------

We can consider adjusting the following properties in the Kafka producer configuration:

delivery.timeout.ms: Specifies the maximum time to wait for a message to be acknowledged by the Kafka broker. This property determines the
timeout period for the producer. You can increase this value if you're experiencing frequent TimeoutException errors. The default value is 
120,000 milliseconds (120 seconds).

request.timeout.ms: Defines the maximum amount of time the producer will wait for a response from the Kafka broker when sending a message. 
If no response is received within this timeout, the producer will consider the request as failed. You can increase this value if you're encountering
TimeoutException errors due to slow network or broker response times. The default value is 30,000 milliseconds (30 seconds).

max.block.ms: Sets the maximum time the send() method will block when the producer buffer is full or metadata is unavailable. If the buffer is full 
and messages cannot be sent within this time, a TimeoutException will be thrown. You can adjust this value to control how long the producer will 
wait before considering it a timeout situation. The default value is 60,000 milliseconds (60 seconds).

Adjusting these properties allows you to fine-tune the timeout behavior of the Kafka producer to better suit your specific requirements and network
conditions. However, it's important to strike a balance and avoid excessively long timeout values that could lead to increased latency or potential 
issues in the event of a failure.


SerializationException: 
-----------------------

This error is thrown when there is an issue serializing the key or value data before sending it to Kafka. It can occur if the data is not compatible 
with the specified serializer or if there are serialization errors in the code.

UnavailableProducerException: 
-----------------------------

This error indicates that the producer is unable to establish a connection with any available Kafka broker. It can occur when all brokers are down 
or unreachable.

NetworkException or LeaderNotAvailableException: 
------------------------------------------------

These errors occur when there are network issues or when the leader for a particular partition is not available. They can be transient and may 
resolve themselves when the network or leader becomes available.

RecordTooLargeException:
------------------------

This error is raised when the size of the record being sent exceeds the max.request.size configuration property. To resolve this error, you can 
increase the max.request.size or split the record into smaller chunks.  [this is server-side property]


02. Kafka Consumer Exceptions
------------------------------

Kafka consumers, several exceptions can occur depending on the specific scenario and configuration. Here are some common exceptions that you may encounter:

OffsetOutOfRangeException: 
--------------------------

This exception occurs when a consumer tries to fetch records from an invalid offset. It typically happens when the consumer's offset is out of range, 
meaning it is either too old or too new.


CommitFailedException: 
-----------------------

This exception indicates that the consumer encountered an error while committing offsets to the Kafka broker. It can happen if the offsets could not be 
committed due to broker unavailability or other issues.


InterruptException: 
-------------------

This exception occurs when a thread, typically the consumer's thread, is interrupted while it is in a blocking operation such as poll(). It can be 
triggered by an external signal or manual termination.


SerializationException: 
-----------------------

This exception occurs when there is a problem deserializing the data received from Kafka. It can be caused by using an incompatible deserializer or 
if the data format has changed since it was produced.


03- Kafka Cluster Exceptions
-----------------------------

 some common exceptions that you may encounter while interacting with a Kafka cluster:

TimeoutException:
----------------

This exception occurs when an operation takes longer than the configured timeout period. It can happen when waiting for
metadata, leader election, or when sending/receiving data.

UnknownTopicOrPartitionException: 
---------------------------------

This exception indicates that the requested topic or partition does not exist on the Kafka cluster. 
It can occur when trying to produce or consume data from non-existent topics or partitions.

LeaderNotAvailableException: 
----------------------------

This exception is raised when the leader for a partition is not available. It can occur during leader election, 
replication delays, or when a broker goes offline.

NotLeaderForPartitionException:
-------------------------------

This exception indicates that the broker receiving the request is not the leader for the given partition. 
It can happen when the client connects to a non-leading broker or when the leader changes during the operation.

OffsetOutOfRangeException: 
---------------------------

This exception occurs when an offset provided by the consumer is out of range. It can happen when the requested offset
is before the earliest available offset or after the latest available offset.

GroupAuthorizationException or GroupCoordinatorNotAvailableException:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

These exceptions occur when there are issues with the consumer group coordinator. They can be caused by authorization failures or when the
coordinator is not available.

NetworkException or BrokerNotAvailableException:
------------------------------------------------

These exceptions indicate network-related issues or when a broker is not available or unreachable. 
They can occur due to network connectivity problems or when a broker fails.

ProducerFencedException or InvalidTxnStateException:
----------------------------------------------------

These exceptions are specific to transactions in Kafka. ProducerFencedException occurs when a producer with the same transactional.id
is already active. InvalidTxnStateException occurs when an operation is not valid for the current 
transactional state.
