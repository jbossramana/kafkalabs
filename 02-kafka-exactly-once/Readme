Kafka provides:
Automatic group management & Partition assignment.
Offset and consumer positions control.

Advantages:
Allows us to parallel process a topic.
Automatically manages partition assignment.
Detects entry/exit/failure of a consumer and perform partition rebalancing activity.

Downside of automatic partition assignment is:

We don't have control over the partition assignment. We can't decide which 
partitions will be assigned to which consumer. 
Kafka takes this decision. So, with a custom partitioning strategy; this automatic 
partition assignment will create problems for us .

create table tss_data(skey varchar(50), svalue varchar(50));
create table tss_offsets(topic_name varchar(50), partitions int, offset int);
insert into tss_offsets values('SensorTopic1',0,0);
insert into tss_offsets values('SensorTopic1',1,0);
insert into tss_offsets values('SensorTopic1',2,0);
